Movie catalog made with React.js, Node.js and MongoDB. See the frontend part [in a separate repository](https://github.com/vpast/movie_catalog_frontend).
The catalog allows to browse through over 24,000 movies with the ability to filter them by genre and year.
The home page shows five random movies at random and can be refreshed to get another five.
The "Movies" page is the main access to the catalog, with filters and pagination on it.
The "Archives" page has a slightly different functionality: it allows to select two years and see the movies that were released in the time period between them.
